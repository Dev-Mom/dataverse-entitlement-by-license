# Dataverse Entitlement By License

## Struggling with Dataverse capacity management & overages? 
By default, all entitled Dataverse capacity is kept in one giant tenant-level pool available for use by any (premium) Power Platform application or environment. While this helps ensure storage capacity can quickly and easily go where it's needed, it can also make it difficult to determine where the storage *should* go based on licensing entitlements. 

This can be especially problematic for organizations housing multiple departments, operating companies, etc. within a single tenant, and need to allocate storage capacity based on license entitlements **...until now!!** :boom:
